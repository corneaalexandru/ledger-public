# Changelog

Ledger Public follows the private Ledger development stream. Public releases contain the same shared UI/core behavior where it is safe to publish, without private data or credentials.

## 2026-06-17

- Mirrored the shared Statements Import UI wording so queued rows show records, target identifiers, and target sheets instead of transaction-only labels.
- Rounded fractional trade quantities to six decimal places in shared trade-table displays.

## 2026-06-15

- Added a browser setup flow that captures the Google service-account key, Google Sheet URL, Project Currency, and local profile name/surname/email before seeding.
- Expanded starter Google Sheets with richer mock income, expense, transfer, account, trade, portfolio, category, FX, classification-rule, and setup-reference rows.
- Updated install documentation to spell out Google Sheets API enablement, service-account creation, Sheet sharing, and native Google Sheets setup.
- Expanded the README screenshot gallery to cover setup, account details, Insights, chart views, Targets in all/year/month modes, Statements Import, Trades, Portfolio, Planning, Settings, and About.
- Added release checks for the new web setup first-run path so clean installs do not create local CSV or spreadsheet artifacts.
- Changed target progress bars to use visible dark-gray achieved fills in dark mode instead of near-black fills that disappear on the black background.
- Removed the separate setup-guide button and moved the Google Cloud, Sheet sharing, and Ledger setup instructions into the web checklist.
- Standardized native Google Sheet setup so all Ledger tabs get the same grid size, row height, column width, frozen header row, and header styling.
- Switched Google Sheet converted amount cells to native Google Sheets currency formulas instead of treating starter FX rows as the conversion source.
- Added launcher port fallback so an occupied default port automatically rolls to the next free port.

## 2026-06-14

- Added total rows to the monthly target income and expense category model tables so each breakdown shows target, actual, and share or over-ceiling totals.
- Reduced data-health noise by treating valid zero FX values as present, ignoring deleted rows, checking stale prices only for active trades, and treating explicit manual transactions as linked.
- Hardened the SQLite snapshot cache with WAL mode and a longer busy timeout for concurrent local UI reads.
- Aligned shared schema metadata with the app's `txn_` and `trd_` ID prefixes and full Google Sheet column ranges.

## 2026-06-13

- Moved drawer scrolling into a padded body region and let email previews expand naturally so imported statement scrollbars no longer float through preview content.
- Kept subpage tab bars and Settings/About dividers in normal page flow so they no longer float over scrolled content.
- Collapsed Portfolio name/code quick filters so `Portfolio 1` and `P1` render as one portfolio identity.
- Prevented imported statement PDF previews from trapping scroll inside transaction drawers.
- Changed account and transaction country edit fields to plain two-letter country-code inputs without browser/datalist autofill suggestions.
- Kept scroll position inside register tables when opening or closing detail drawers from any row.
- Improved print/PDF output with landscape A4 layout, compact matching typography, fitted tables, and cleaner print headers.
- Expanded Financial Health scoring with retained-capital shortfall, ledger leakage, and compounding deficit inputs.
- Matched Portfolio quick filters to register behavior with removable chips for portfolio, provider, ticker, and funding fields.
- Moved the shared account `country_code` schema next to account type so native Google Sheets expose Country in the expected place.
- Removed the legacy local file writer so Ledger Public uses native Google Sheets as the supported setup path.
- Labeled the Settings content as the General settings subpage under the page header.
- Replaced the public starter-file workflow with native Google Sheet setup that creates and seeds tabs directly.
- Seeded account country codes in the public starter rows so the Accounts Country column is populated immediately.
- Flattened Overview insights into one continuous bordered bullet list and removed the group headers.
- Added a Settings header/content divider so the page matches the About page boundary treatment.

## 2026-06-12

- Added account country support across the Accounts Google Sheet schema, API filters, table, details, and edit form.
- Standardized Overview, Settings, and About bullet sections with the same left-border document-list treatment.
- Removed the repeated single-month target recap row so month drilldowns open directly on category models.
- Converted the Overview headline metrics from cards into the same plain bullet-list style as the supporting sections.
- Added persistent transaction drawer back controls so statement attachments, details, and edit views can switch without closing the drawer.
- Added a weighted Financial Health score to Overview using liquidity, cashflow, savings, target discipline, debt, concentration, capital momentum, and data quality.
- Bounded target progress bars so red over-target segments scale inside the available period column instead of spilling into adjacent values.

- Moved structural overspending from the Overview headline row into Risk bullets and promoted Liquid Capital in its place.
- Reduced Overview to five headline insight cards and moved supporting metrics into Settings-style bullet sections.

- Corrected yearly and monthly target row bars to show expense ceiling progress with red over-ceiling extension and fixed bar alignment.
- Reordered Settings bullets into a cleaner profile, project, source truth, sync, connections, thresholds, and preferences flow.
- Tightened Settings inline inputs and action buttons so fields match text scale and threshold units no longer duplicate.

- Added compact target progress bars beside year and month labels in target summary tables.
- Matched Settings to the plain About bullet-list style.
- Standardized Settings and About into simpler line-by-line document rows.
- Removed the redundant label, filename, and release-history text above the About changelog content.
- Removed the duplicate divider line below detail drawer headers.
- Extended monthly target progress bars with a red proportional over-target segment.
- Kept transaction date, month, and year quick filters active when switching to Insights or Targets.
- Fixed monthly target drilldowns so month rows stay in Targets and keep the top period selector in sync.
- Flattened Settings into one page and standardized Settings/About into one-card-per-item insight grids.
- Added grey planned and black achieved progress bars to monthly target category rows.
- Moved About into its own sidebar page below Settings and removed the raw markdown opener from the changelog view.
- Reworked Settings sections into compact cards and added Settings > Profile for name, surname, and email.
- Removed the browser username/password setup flow from the launcher and kept the profile store informational only.
