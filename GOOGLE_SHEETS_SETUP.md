# Google Sheets Setup

Ledger Public uses a user-owned Google Sheet as its database.

## 1. Create The Ledger Sheet

Create a blank Google Sheet in Google Drive. Do not upload or convert an XLSX file.

Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL:

```text
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE/edit
```

## 2. Create A Service Account

In Google Cloud:

1. Create or choose a project.
2. Enable the Google Sheets API.
3. Create a service account.
4. Create a JSON key.
5. Save the JSON file locally, for example:

```text
credentials/ledger-service-account.json
```

## 3. Share The Sheet

Open the JSON file and find `client_email`.

Share the Google Sheet with that email as Editor.

## 4. Run The Wizard

On macOS, double-click:

```text
start_ledger_public.command
```

Or run manually:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-google.txt
python3 scripts/setup_google.py
```

The wizard writes `.env` once:

```env
LEDGER_STORE=google
LEDGER_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id_here
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=credentials/ledger-service-account.json
LEDGER_PROJECT_CURRENCY=EUR
```

The wizard creates and seeds the required Ledger tabs directly in native Google Sheets format.
It also asks for Project Currency during setup. Supported values are EUR, USD, AED, RON, GBP, CHF, CAD, AUD, INR, and JPY.
Profile details are managed later in Settings > Profile and stored locally in `.ledger_profile.json`.

## 5. Start Ledger

```bash
python3 server.py --store google --open
```

Re-run setup at any time with:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup_google.py --force
```
